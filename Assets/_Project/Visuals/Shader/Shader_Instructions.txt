Below are instructions on the shaders and their purpose.
This is solely for readability and in order to facilitate
the usability of the shaders and the folders herein.

1.	Folder Structure
    There are 4 folders, relevant are only the materials folder and - if needed- the texture folder.

    1.1.	Material Folder
        Each material is assigned to an eponymous shader.
        The creation of a new material is only necessary when settings (as in either texture or values) 
		need to differ. 
        Materials should always be named according to their corresponding shader(graph).
        It is advisable to add the suffix -material or -mat to each material to heighten the readability.

    1.2.	Shadergraph and Subgraph Folder
        The shadergraphs and subgraphs of these shaders are stored here. There is no need to edit these. 

    1.3.	TestMaterials Folder
        Herein are materials solely used for testing shaders. The use of these will not be explained further.

    1.4.	Texture Folder
        The textures required for certain shaders and materials are stored here. 
		Since some materials’ textures can be changed, it is vital that these new textures are also 
		stored in this folder.  


2.	How To Use Shaders/Materials
    To use a shader a material must be applied to the object. 
    Hereby it is important to remember that a material is assigned to a shader. 
	While in the inspector of an object this should NEVER be changed since it is easy to override 
	the material on the object if the material is not the corresponding (to the shader). 
	Meaning it can be quite difficult to track down this error. 
    Settings on materials are global. So, each object the materialshader is applied 
	on has the same settings. 
	If different settings are required for a certain object it is mandatory to create a new material
	with the desired configuration. 
    To apply a shader to a new material, simply select the required shader in the inspector under 
	Shader – Shader Graphs.


3.	Materials
    3.1.	Blur_Material
        The Blur_Material can be used to blur areas/objects that are located behind the object
	    the effect is applied to. 
        The BlurValue can be adjusted at will. The default value is 0.03

    3.2.	Boundaries_Dissolve_Material
	    The Boundaries_Dissolve_Material can be used to visualize the barrier in terms of changing 
		colors and a certain rhythm. The noise_Scale and the time can be adjusted. 
        The noise_Scale determines how big the generated noise map is. The default is 1
        The time value determines how fast the floating effect looks. The default is 1

    3.3.	CrackedIce_Material
	    The CrackedIce_Material visualizes the surface of an ice plane. 
		Here the values are mostly dependent upon each other, meaning that changing one can also 
		impact another.
		The following textures can be changed:
		TextureCrackMask: This is the mask of the cracks on the ice
		TextureAlbedo: This is the overall texture, shown most prominently 
		TextureNoise: This noise texture is a simple perlin noise and adds depth to the shader
		TextureNormal: The corresponding normal map to the albedo
		TextureRoughness: The roughness for the cracks and the ice in general

		The following values can be changed:
		ParallaxOffset: This is the value of the parallax effect as seen on the cracks. 
		                It adds to the depth of the ice. The default value is 0.003. 
						Here it is advisable to keep the effect minimal
         IceBrightness: The ice brightness influences the parallax of the cracks. 
		                A value under 0 colors the cracks black and makes the ice brighter, 
						while a value over 0 darkens the ice and brightens the cracks. The default is 0.1
		Greenness/Redness/Blueness: These influence the tint of the ice. The default values are 0.02/0/1
		PowerOfFresnel: In general, the Fresnel effect differs reflectance on a surface depending on the 
		                viewing angle. More is light is reflected when the grazing angle is approached. 
						Only small values are advised to be used. The default value is 0. 

    3.4.	DissolveWater_Mat
	    The DissolveWater_Mat is to achieve a flowing water effect, that also distorts the 
		object/ areas behind the object. 
		The DistanceDissolveTarget Script can be attached to this material, meaning it can dissolve on 
		contact with the player. 
		!Do not change the Position Value! 
		It is exposed solely for scripting purposes. 
		The following values can be changed:
		Distance: This is the distance between an object tagged player and this object. It is a script value. 
				  The greater the distance the earlier the material dissolves upon contact. 
				  The default is 2
		SpeedNormal: This determines the flow speed and general direction of the normal map. 
		             Above 0 it flows upwards and below 0 it flows downwards. The default value is 0.1
		SpeedTex: This changes the speed of the cloud effect on the material. The default is 1/1
		SpeedFlow_1/ SpeedFlow_2: To achieve the effect of a seemingly chaotic flow two textures are used. 
		                          The default values are: 0.13/0.26 for Flow_1 and 0.34/0.12 for Flow_2
		LerpColor_1/LerpColor_2: The cracks colors are lerping between two color values. 
		                         These can be changed at will. The default values are #0031FF and #00FFE8
        DistortionTex: This is the texture that creates the flow of the distortion effect. It can be changed at will but is its
		               necessary that this texture provides RGBA channels.
	    NormalTex: This texture controls the distortion effect. To control how much is visible behind the object this 
		           must be changed
		Texture_2D: This texture is projected onto the plane and to achieve the desired effect please make sure this texture 
		            is the corresponding one to the normal map. 

    3.5.	LevelBoundaries_Ice_Material
	    The LevelBoundaries_Ice_Material visualizes the dynamic ice cracks for the level border.
		The DistanceDissolveTarget Script can be attached to this material, meaning it can dissolve on 
		contact with the player. 
		!Do not change the Position Value! 
		It is exposed solely for scripting purposes. 
		The textures are not exposed here because they are implemented for this specific type of crack 
		texture. 
		The following values can be changed:
		Distance: This is the distance between an object tagged player and this object. It is a script value.
		          The greater the distance the earlier the material dissolves upon contact. The default is 2
		EdgeWidth: This describes the width of the color of the cracks. 
	               The lower the number the less the cracks are visible. The default value is 30
		FrequencyColor: This determines the frequency speed of the color change. It is faster the higher 
		                the number. The default value is 0.5
		EdgeColor: This is the color on which the cracks are projected. Its default value is #FFFFFF
		SpeedFlow_1/ SpeedFlow_2: To achieve the effect of a seemingly chaotic flow two textures are used. 
		                          The default values are: 0.13/0.26 for Flow_1 and 0.34/0.12 for Flow_2
		LerpColor_1/LerpColor_2: The cracks colors are lerping between two color values. 
                                 These can be changed at will. The default values are #0031FF and #00FFE8

	3.6. Portal_Material
	    The Portal_Material is used to simulate a portal effect.
		The following values can be changed:
		TwirlStrength: This value simulates the strength of the portal twirl and the direction of it. The default value is 10.
		Scale: This describes the scale of the voronoi effect that influences the twirl. The default value is 3
		SpeedPortal: The determines the speed of the twirl. The default value is 0.5
		Mask: This is a texture that influences the placement of the portal twirl. The default texture is unitys default 
		      particle texture
		ColorPortal: This sets the color of the portal. 
		DissolveAmount_Portal: The dissolve amount is controlled here. For a value less than 0 it appears brighter and therefore
		                       it does not dissolve that much. For a positive value it dissolves more and appears more dull.

    3.7. SnowTest_Material
	    The SnowTest_Material is used to simulate fallen powder snow.  
		The following values/ textures can be altered:
		BaseMap: This is the base texture the snow is applied on. It can be changed to any texture. 
		SnowDirection: The direction of the snow is determined here. 
		               The X, Y and Z are the different directions. 
		SnowOpacity: This determines the opacity of the snow. Its default is 0.5
